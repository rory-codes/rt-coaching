### Detailed overview of features 

#### Site wide 

**navigation** 
* The website works well on a range of screen sizes and devices.
* Site layout and navigation are intuitive, providing easy access to different sections and pages.
* I used a mobile-first approach, meaning we ensure that it works on mobiles and making adjustments accordingly for larger screens.
* This should create understanding for users to navigate the site due to adherence with common industry standards.
* The navigation also includes a 'call to action' button to provide a direct link to the booking enquiry form. This provides easy access for users should they wish to send a booking enquiry at any point during site navigation.

**Header**
* The header is the first content site users will see and therefore, I wanted to use a combination of brand colours, brand logo and a hero image to grab user attention and set the tone for the website, whilst also aligning with the brand. 
* The header also includes a heading, subheading and paragraph to introduce the customer to the brand and services provided.
* There is a 'call to action' button included to direct users to the booking enquiry form. If a user already knows they want to book then this gives them easy access to the booking enquiry form.

**Footer**
* The footer section contains links to social media platforms allowing site users to connect and view content across different platforms.
* The footer contains contact information so that users can easily access this as they navigate the site.

* The homepage uses bootstraps grid system to align content. This includes a combination of divs with the following classes: container, row and collumns (col-12, col-md-6, col-lg-12 etc) to achieve the desired effect across different screen sizes.
* To Address this point, I have ensured that the website follows a logical flow of information. Images are used for a specficic purpose such as the 'hero' image in the header used to create an instant impact to let users know the nature of RT coaching. This is also linked with branding and a call to action button.
* There are two sections below the header, each with a clear purpose. They are as follows:

**Header section**
* The header section includes a 'hero' image to introduce the user to the type of business.
* A brand logo with opacity targeted to produce a nice visual effect and include the brand logo.
* Background color has been used, using brand colours to highlight information over the hero image and provide consistency with the logo.
* The header includes headings, paragraphs and and a 'call to action' button to direct users to the booking enquiry form.

**Sports section**
* The sports section introduces users to the current sports on offer. Including: Football, Tag-rugby & Multi-sports.
* The sports section uses cards from bootstrap, which are edited using CSS and bootstrap classes to achieve a customised result.

* Each card includes an image, header, paragraph, list (which has been customised to achieve the desired result) and a booking button.
* CSS styling include a range of changes, including media queries to assure that it works efficiently accross various screen sizes.

**Gallery**
* The gallery uses bootstraps grid system to allign content on different devices and screen sizes.
* The gallery includes 12 images acquired from various sites including but not limited to pexels. All images are stock images and do not conflict with copyright legislation. This adds value to the website and RT coaching by showcasing images to entice users to book a session and it adds values to users by allowing them to see images that align with the business and types of activities.
* The images are styled using CSS to provide a border, margin, padding, border radius to align with styling in other areas of the site. All colours used are brand colours, providing further aligning with the brand identity.

## Testing

The delivered website was developed and tested using Chrome DevTools to look for accessibility problems.

The following criteria were the main focus of the testing:
* To guarantee accessibility for visually impaired users, each form has a "screen-read" tag attached.
* In order to demonstrate the significance and meaning of the text, headings are not omitted.
* For screen readers, alternative descriptive language is included with every image and media item. This helps 
 ensure adherence to the suggested coding protocol for WCAG 2.1.
* Ensure website is responsive and performs well across various screen sizes with no obvious errors.

### Reactivity

Every page was examined to make sure it would work on Chrome, Edge, and Firefox screens that were 320 pixels or larger.


**Testing protocol:**

1. Go to [Portfolio](https://rory-codes.github.io/rt-coaching/index.html) in an open browser.
2. Right-click and select "Inspect" to open the developer tools.
3. Reduce to 320px and set to responsive.
5. To adjust the responsive window's minimum and maximum width, click and drag it back and forth.

**Anticipated:**

No graphics are stretched, and the website works well on all screen widths.
There isn't a horizontal scroll.
Nothing overlaps.

**Actual:**

The website behaved as expected apart from the following issues:
•	The footer did not stretch content across the full width and became unaligned on devices 465px and under.
•	The cards in the sports section on screens above 1400px become unaligned due to the images increasing in size.
•	The booking form entries become unaligned on screens 1400px and above
•	The booking button on the navbar becomes unaligned on tablets.

This was tested manually on the following devices:
* Iphone 12
* LG Thinkpad laptop.
* Devtools various phones: Iphone SE, Iphone XR, Iphone 12 pro, Iphone 14 pro max, pixel 7, Samsung galaxy s8+, Samsung galaxy S20 ultra.

### Performance, Accessibility & best practices Issues & Fixes
Manual tests were performed to identify problematic issues, they are as follows:

#### Issue #1: Form submission
- **Problem**: The form would submit without required entries being entered.
- **Fix**: The button to submit the form was incorrect, changed to type=submit.

#### Issue #2: Navbar not accessible on mobile devices.
- **Problem**: Scrolling down from the navbar on tablets and mobiles, created a bad user experience.
- **Fix**: The following CSS was applied 'position: fixed' to ensure that the navbar stays at the top of the viewport and is much more easily accessed.

#### Problem #3: Large Images with png file type Affecting Loading Time: 
-**Problem**: Image files containing too much data were taking longer to load the webpage and driving down performance.
-**Fix**: I used squoosh to compress all image files from "png" to "webp.". Dramatically imrpoving performance from 67-82.

#### Issue #4: Footer alignment out of sync on mobile devices
- **Problem**: Footer is not spanning the full width on mobile devices causing the map to look unaligned.
- **Fix**: Solved this by changing col-6 to col-12, col-md-6. This means that the map sits below contact information on mobile devices. This moves away from original wireframe design. However, I dont think it impacts UX negatively and solves major alignment issues.

#### Issue #5: Alignment issues on large screens
- **Problem**: alignment of form labels and input fields on large screen sizes (1400px and above) in booking.html and card images causing alignment issues on same screen sizes.
- **Fix**:
- 2 media queries were introduces on screens above 1400px. They are: targeting the image size in the cards within the sports section and targeting padding and margins in form-label class within the booking ID.
 
#### Issue #6: Footer wording not meeting required contrast ratios.
- **Problem**: Accessibility issues with the text in the footer.
- **Fix**: Change the color to ensure accessibility whilst also remaining consistent with brand colouring, prioritising accessibility over initial colour design.
- 
#### Issue #7: When navigating to sections with ID's header not visible.
- **Problem**: Alignment of headers when navbar links are used means that you cannot see the heading due to the fixed navbar
- **Fix**: padding top added to h1 elements and this solved the issue.

#### Issue #8: Slow Font Loading accross all pages.
**Problem**:Performance was being slowed down by imported Google fonts.
**Fix**: Preloaded fonts were added to the head using `<link rel="preload">` and `<link rel="preconnect"…>`. This will guarantee that the preferred font styles are loaded first, improving UX and speeding up page loads.

  
#### Issue #9: Header section causing slow performance due to large contentful plain.
- **Problem**: Large contentful plains slowing down performance.
- **Fix**: Preloaded certain content in the home page and gallery to boost performance. link rel=preload" as="image". Also introduced loading="lazy" for items that were not visible straight away to users when they open the  site.

#### Issue #10: Unusued code slowing down performance.
- **Problem**: Unused CSS or javascript slowing down performance.
- **Fix**: Remove unsed CSS and JS for bootstrap which wasn't used on certain pages.

#### Issue #11: Issues with best practices due to width and height of gallery images.
-**Problem**: Gallery images not adhering to correct height and width ratios.
-**Fix**: Adjusted width and height to max-width and max-height. Previously I was forcing images into a consistent size. However, I believe it works better and looks better with different sized images.

#### Issue #12: Heading elements are not in a sequentially-descending order
-**Problem**: Heading did not move through sequentially-descending order and instead had a h3 after a h5.
-**Fix**: Change headings to follow correct order.

Selection any selection in session drop down.
Message: This is a test.
Click Submit

Expected:

User should be prompted to enter an email address with correct format. 

Actual:

The user is prompted to enter an email address with the correct format. Once that is done, form submits as expected.

**Icons (link) for Social Media in the Footer**

Expected:
 Social media icon testing was done to ensure that links open in a new tab, and direct to correct website, and have a hover effect to let users know they are links.
 
 Actual:
 As anticipated, each item launched a new tab when clicked, and there was a color change when hovered over.  Every link points to the anticipated website.


**Contact Details in the Footer**

 To ensure that users could contact the site directly, testing was done on the contact section.  Email to launch an email application on any device, and phone number to initiate a call action from mobile devices.

**Phone number:**

### Unfixed Bugs
Issue #1: Form to send email to target email address and direct to success.html for comfirmation after form is submitted.
Fix: To options were implemented temporarily, they were:
* Add a mailto: enquiries..... but this created a bad UX and opened the email in a seperate application. This also impacted the websites ability to navigate to success.html after submission.
* Use a seperate host site such as 'formspree'. However, this created loading times and would go to an external page after submission. This was not satisfactory and therefore, was removed.
Future fix: This will be left for a future update. Whereby javascript will be used to ensure that the website meets the following criteria: An email address is sent without opening a seperate application, it does not significantly slow down performance and the user is directed to successs.html after submission.

Issue #2: Gallery images are not the correct aspect ratio. I have improved this element but this is something that could be improved to speed up performance and best practices.
Fix: Upload images again with the desired size predetermined. Also, aspect ratio in line with original file. All images changed to webp once this is acceptable.


## Deployment
### Deployment to Github Pages
The portfolio website deployed using GitHub Pages

**Steps to Deploy site:**
* Sync files to a GitHub repository from VS-Code.
* Go to the Settings tab in the repository.

* Under Branch, select main
* Click Save. Live link can be found ![here] (https://rory-codes.github.io/rt-coaching/)

## Credits
* Bootstrap - This website's code was utilised to construct the navbar and cards' structural foundation according to my pertinent preferences and guarantee that the site's styling is consistent throughout. Additionally, bootstrap was helpful in giving Javascript code for a responsive and functional structure, such as the navbar that collapses when a mobile view button is clicked.
  
* Javascript - Javascript should also be commended because it was utilized to adjust to Bootstrap 5.3

* Squoosh - Squoosh was used to compress files, changing them from PNG to WebP, which shortened the time the website took to load.

* Code Institute - Resources from the Code Institute, such as my tutor Mo Shami, who gave advice on how approach the project.
 The codes utilized in this project were first learned via walkthrough projects such as love-running and boardwalk-games.
 Code institute also helped me learn about important principles such as: HTML, CSS and bootstrap. As well as many other areas such as; how to link to git hub and approach work in logical, well thought-out manor.

*Wendy Purdy - Wendy has been really helpful with her commitment and help towards my development. We have weekly meetings and/or 1-1's and she has been a great line of support. Please see below for an example of how she helped me repair my form (which wasn't submitted as intended)
 ![Home](docs/read-me-images/wendy.png)
* W3schools - Used to refer back to previously learned principles, such as pseudo-classes and form elements. This was really helpful when building the site.
![Home](docs/read-me-images/w3.png)

Thank you! This is my first project via the code institute - Full stack web development (level 5) diploma. I have learnt a lot through this journey and I am proud of the site I have deployed, despite obvious limitations. I am excited to continue this journey and learn about different technologies and languages to guide my coding journey.
