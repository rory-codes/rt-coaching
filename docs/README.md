**navigation**

* The header is the first content site users will see and therefore, I wanted to use a combination of brand colours, brand logo and a hero image to grab user attention and set the tone for the website, whilst also aligning with the brand. 
* The header also includes a heading, subheading and paragraph to introduce the customer to the brand and services provided.

* To Address this point, I have ensured that the website follows a logical flow of information.
